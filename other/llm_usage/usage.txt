LLM: ChatGPT-4.
Date: 2 January 2024


User
I have downloaded data for this project
E.6.1 Task
Working as part of a team of one to three people, and in an entirely reproducible way, please build a linear, or generalized linear, model to forecast the winner of the upcoming US presidential election using “poll-of-polls” (Blumenthal 2014; Pasek 2015) and then write a short paper telling a story.
You should use this starter folder.
You are welcome to use R, Python, or a combination.
You can get data about polling outcomes from here (search for “Download the data”, then select Presidential general election polls (current cycle), then “Download”).
Pick one pollster in your sample, and deep-dive on their methodology in an appendix to your paper. In particular, in addition to conveying a sense of the pollster of interest, this appendix should include a discussion of the survey’s methodology, and its key features, strengths, and weaknesses. For instance:
what is the population, frame, and sample;
how is the sample recruited;
what sampling approach is taken, and what are some of the trade-offs of this;
how is non-response handled;
what is good and bad about the questionnaire.
In another appendix, please put together an idealized methodology and survey that you would run if you had a budget of $100K and the task of forecasting the US presidential election. You should detail the sampling approach that you would use, how you would recruit respondents, data validation, and any other relevant aspects of interest. Also be careful to address any poll aggregation or other features of your methodology. You should actually implement your survey using a survey platform like Google Forms. A link to this should be included in the appendix. Additionally, a copy of the survey should be included in the appendix.
Submit a link to the GitHub repo.
There should be no evidence that this is a class paper.

Note:

Make sure to install all the necessary R packages before running these scripts:
r
Copy code
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "lubridate", "tidyr", "testthat", "httr", "readr"))
Ensure that you have a directory named data and plots in your working directory, or use dir.create() as shown in the scripts to create them.

Replace placeholder URLs or paths with the actual ones if necessary.

These scripts are designed to be run sequentially, from 00-simulate_data.R to 07-replications.R.

The scripts are self-contained and do not reference any class materials or assignments.

Feel free to modify the scripts to better suit your specific data and requirements.

Thought for 6 seconds

Thank you for the clarification! I understand now that your data includes multiple candidates beyond just Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, including third-party candidates like Jill Stein, Cornel West, and others, and covers all states.

I'll revise the scripts to handle multiple candidates and states accordingly. Below are the updated scripts for your project, tailored to work with the actual data you've provided.

00-simulate_data.R
Since you're using real data, you might not need to simulate data. However, if you still wish to simulate data that reflects the complexity of multiple candidates and states, here's an updated script.

r
Copy code
# 00-simulate_data.R

# Load necessary packages
library(dplyr)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Number of polls to simulate
num_polls <- 100

# Possible values
pollster_ids <- 1:10
pollsters <- paste("Pollster", pollster_ids)
states <- c(NA, state.name)  # All US states
methodologies <- c("Live Phone", "Online Panel", "IVR/Online", "IVR/Live Phone", "Online")
population_types <- c("lv", "rv", "a")
candidates <- c("Donald Trump", "Kamala Harris", "Jill Stein", "Cornel West", "Chase Oliver", "Robert F. Kennedy")
candidate_ids <- c(16651, 16661, 31116, 31097, 31790, 31042)

# Initialize empty data frame
poll_data <- data.frame()

for (i in 1:num_polls) {
  poll_id <- i
  pollster_id <- sample(pollster_ids, 1)
  pollster <- pollsters[pollster_id]
  start_date <- as.Date("2024-10-01") + sample(0:30, 1)
  end_date <- start_date + sample(1:5, 1)
  sample_size <- sample(500:2000, 1)
  methodology <- sample(methodologies, 1)
  population <- sample(population_types, 1)
  state <- sample(states, 1)
  
  # Generate percentages for candidates
  percentages <- runif(length(candidates), min=0, max=1)
  percentages <- percentages / sum(percentages) * 100
  
  # Create rows for each candidate
  poll_rows <- data.frame(
    poll_id = poll_id,
    pollster_id = pollster_id,
    pollster = pollster,
    start_date = start_date,
    end_date = end_date,
    sample_size = sample_size,
    methodology = methodology,
    population = population,
    state = state,
    candidate_name = candidates,
    candidate_id = candidate_ids,
    pct = percentages
  )
  
  poll_data <- rbind(poll_data, poll_rows)
}

# Save simulated data to CSV
dir.create("data", showWarnings = FALSE)
write.csv(poll_data, "data/simulated_polls.csv", row.names=FALSE)
01-test_simulated_data.R
Update tests to accommodate multiple candidates.

r
Copy code
# 01-test_simulated_data.R

# Load necessary packages
library(testthat)
library(dplyr)

# Read the simulated data
simulated_data <- read.csv("data/simulated_polls.csv")

# Perform tests
test_that("Data has correct columns", {
  expected_cols <- c("poll_id", "pollster_id", "pollster", "start_date", "end_date", "sample_size",
                     "methodology", "population", "state", "candidate_name", "candidate_id", "pct")
  expect_true(all(expected_cols %in% colnames(simulated_data)))
})

test_that("Percentage sums to 100 per poll", {
  pct_sums <- simulated_data %>%
    group_by(poll_id) %>%
    summarise(total_pct = sum(pct))
  expect_true(all(abs(pct_sums$total_pct - 100) < 1e-6))
})

test_that("No missing values in key columns", {
  key_cols <- c("poll_id", "pollster_id", "candidate_name", "pct")
  for (col in key_cols) {
    expect_false(any(is.na(simulated_data[[col]])))
  }
})

cat("All tests passed for simulated data.\n")
02-download_data.R
Assuming you're downloading data from FiveThirtyEight or another source, here's how to update the script.

r
Copy code
# 02-download_data.R

# Load necessary packages
library(readr)

# URL to download the data
data_url <- "https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls-page/president_general_polls.csv"

# Destination file path
dest_file <- "data/polling_data.csv"

# Download the data
download.file(data_url, destfile = dest_file, method = "libcurl")

# Read the data
polling_data <- read_csv(dest_file)

# Save the data in RDS format for faster loading later
saveRDS(polling_data, "data/polling_data.rds")
03-clean_data.R
Update the cleaning script to handle multiple candidates and states.

r
Copy code
# 03-clean_data.R

# Load necessary packages
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

Explanation of Changes:

Data Simulation: Updated to include multiple candidates and states.
Data Cleaning: Adjusted to handle multiple candidates, ensuring all candidates are included in the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Enhanced to visualize data for all candidates, not just the main two.
Modeling: Switched to a mixed-effects linear model (lmer) to account for random effects of candidates and pollsters, which is suitable for hierarchical data with multiple groups.
Predictions: Aggregated predictions for each candidate to forecast their average polling percentage and identify the leading candidate.
Notes:

Mixed-Effects Model: The lmer function from the lme4 package allows us to include random effects for candidates and pollsters, which accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data.

Candidate Selection: In the modeling script, I filtered candidates with a significant number of polls to ensure the model has enough data to make reliable estimates. Adjust the threshold as needed based on your data.

Predictions: Since we're predicting the average percentage for each candidate, we can compare these to forecast the winner. This approach accounts for third-party candidates.

Adjustments: Depending on the complexity of your data and the requirements of your project, you might consider more advanced models, such as multinomial logistic regression or Bayesian hierarchical models.

Packages Required:

r
Copy code
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "lubridate", "tidyr", "testthat", "lme4", "readr"))
Data Sources: Ensure the data you're using is up-to-date and accurately reflects the current election cycle.

No Class References: The scripts are self-contained and make no reference to class materials or assignments.

Feel free to further customize the scripts to better fit your data and analysis goals. If you have any questions or need additional assistance with specific parts of the scripts, please let me know!






You said:
the dataset is really big with all info and for download file I already downloaded mannyaly and how does cod work kere?
ChatGPT

Thought for 27 seconds

Understood! If you've already downloaded the dataset manually, we can adjust the scripts to read from your local file instead of downloading it. Additionally, I'll explain how each piece of code works to help you understand how to run and modify the scripts for your project.

Adjusting the Scripts to Use Your Local Data
Since you have the data locally, we'll modify the 02-read_data.R script to read from your file without attempting to download it.

Assuming:

Your data file is named presidential_polls.csv.
The file is located in a folder named data within your project directory.
02-read_data.R
r
Copy code
# 02-read_data.R

# Load necessary packages
library(readr)

# Path to your local data file
data_file <- "data/presidential_polls.csv"

# Read the data
polling_data <- read_csv(data_file)

# Save the data in RDS format for faster loading later
saveRDS(polling_data, "data/polling_data.rds")
Explanation:

Line 5: We specify the path to your local data file.
Line 8: We use read_csv to read the data into R.
Line 11: The data is saved in RDS format for efficient loading in subsequent scripts.
Understanding How the Code Works
I'll walk you through each script, explaining its purpose and how it processes the data.

00-simulate_data.R
Since you're using real data, you can skip this script unless you want to simulate additional data for testing purposes.

01-test_simulated_data.R
Again, if you're not using simulated data, you can skip this script. It's designed to test the integrity of the simulated data.

03-clean_data.R
This script cleans and preprocesses the data to prepare it for analysis.

r
Copy code
# 03-clean_data.R

  filter(
    office_type == "U.S. President",
    stage == "general",
    !is.na(candidate_name),
    !is.na(pct)
  )

# Convert date columns to Date type
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    start_date = as.Date(start_date),
    end_date = as.Date(end_date),
    election_date = as.Date(election_date)
  )

# Ensure percentages are between 0 and 100
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(pct >= 0 & pct <= 100)

# Fill missing states with 'National'
polling_data$state[is.na(polling_data$state)] <- 'National'

# Create a variable for days until election
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    days_until_election = as.numeric(election_date - end_date)
  )

Understanding the Workflow:

Data Reading: The scripts read the data from your local file.
Data Cleaning: Cleaning ensures the data is consistent and ready for analysis.
Data Testing: Testing catches any issues before modeling.
Exploratory Analysis: EDA helps you understand trends and patterns.
Modeling: The model uses statistical methods to predict outcomes.
Prediction: Predictions are made based on the model, and the results are visualized.
How the Code Works with Your Data
Data Structure:

Your dataset contains detailed polling information, including multiple candidates across all states. The scripts are designed to handle this complexity by:

Including all candidates in the analysis.
Accounting for different states and pollsters.
Using models that can handle hierarchical data (e.g., mixed-effects models).
Processing Steps:

Reading Data: The data is read into R and stored in a format that's easy to manipulate.
Cleaning Data: Unnecessary or problematic data is filtered out, and formats are standardized.
Exploratory Analysis: Visualizations and summaries help identify trends and any anomalies.
Modeling Data: Statistical models are built to capture relationships in the data.
Making Predictions: The models are used to predict future or unknown outcomes.
Visualization: Results are plotted to provide a visual understanding of the predictions.
Tips for Working with Large Datasets
Efficient Data Handling:

Use data.table or dplyr for efficient data manipulation.
Consider reading only necessary columns if memory is an issue.
Performance Optimization:

Use efficient data structures.
Avoid unnecessary computations within loops.
Parallel Processing:

For computationally intensive tasks, consider using parallel processing packages like parallel or future.
Customizing the Scripts
Adjust File Paths:

If your data file is named differently or located elsewhere, update the data_file variable in 02-read_data.R.
Filtering Data:

In 03-clean_data.R, you can adjust the filtering criteria to include or exclude certain polls, candidates, or states.
Model Adjustments:

In 06-model_data.R, you can modify the model formula to include additional variables or interactions.
Visualization Enhancements:

Customize plots in 05-exploratory_data_analysis.R and 07-replications.R by changing themes, labels, or plot types.
Understanding the Statistical Model
Mixed-Effects Model:

The lmer function fits a linear mixed-effects model.
Fixed effects: Variables like days_until_election, sample_size, methodology, and population.
Random effects: Variations due to different candidate_factor and pollster_factor.
Why Use Mixed-Effects Models:

They account for the hierarchical structure of the data.
Allow for individual differences among candidates and pollsters.
Interpreting the Results
Model Summary:

Provides estimates for each fixed effect.
Look at the significance (p-values) to understand which variables are strong predictors.
Predicted Percentages:

The aggregated predicted percentages give an estimate of each candidate's support.
The candidate with the highest predicted percentage is forecasted as the winner.
Visualization:

Plots help in comparing the predicted support among candidates.
Time series plots show trends over the campaign period.
Common Issues and Troubleshooting
Package Not Found:

Ensure all packages are installed and loaded using library(package_name).
File Not Found:

Verify that the file paths are correct and that files are in the expected directories.
Data Type Mismatches:

Check that date columns are properly converted to Date type.
Ensure categorical variables are converted to factors before modeling.
Model Convergence Issues:

Sometimes, lmer models may have convergence warnings.
Simplify the model or check for multicollinearity among predictors.
Next Steps
Enhance the Model:

Consider adding more predictors or interaction terms.
Explore other modeling techniques like generalized additive models (GAMs) or machine learning methods.
Validate the Model:

Use techniques like cross-validation to assess the model's predictive performance.
Report Writing:

Use the insights and outputs from these scripts to write your analysis report.
Include plots and statistical summaries to support your conclusions.
Final Notes
Reproducibility:

Keep your scripts organized and document any changes for reproducibility.
No Class References:

Ensure that your scripts and report do not reference any class materials, per your task instructions.
Ask for Help:

If you have questions about specific parts of the code or encounter issues, don't hesitate to ask for clarification.
I hope this detailed explanation helps you understand how the code works with your dataset. Feel free to modify the scripts to better suit your needs, and let me know if you need further assistance with any specific part of the project.






You said:
I have data in csv why we need rds?
ChatGPT

Thought for 29 seconds

You're absolutely right—you don't need to use RDS files if you prefer working directly with CSV files. The scripts initially used RDS files mainly for efficiency in loading and saving data within R, especially for larger datasets. However, it's perfectly acceptable to work with CSV files throughout your analysis.

I'll update the scripts to read and write CSV files directly, and I'll explain how the code works so you can comfortably use it with your CSV data.

Why Use RDS Files?
Efficiency: RDS files can be faster to read and write compared to CSVs, especially with large datasets.
Data Types Preservation: RDS files preserve data types (e.g., dates, factors) without extra parameters.
Single Object Storage: They store a single R object, which can be convenient.
However, these benefits are optional, and for your project, you can work entirely with CSV files.

Updated Scripts to Use CSV Files
02-read_data.R (Updated)
Since you've already downloaded the data and have it in CSV format, you can read it directly.

data_file <- "data/presidential_polls.csv"

# Read the data
polling_data <- read_csv(data_file)

# Proceed to use 'polling_data' in your analysis
Explanation:

Removed the download step since you have the data locally.
Read the data directly from your CSV file using read_csv.
03-clean_data.R (Updated)
Modify this script to read from the CSV file and save the cleaned data back to a CSV.

# Filter for general election polls
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(
    office_type == "U.S. President",
    stage == "general",
    !is.na(candidate_name),
    !is.na(pct)
  )

# Convert date columns to Date type
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    start_date = as.Date(start_date),
    end_date = as.Date(end_date),
    election_date = as.Date(election_date)
  )

# Ensure percentages are between 0 and 100
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(pct >= 0 & pct <= 100)

# Fill missing state with 'National'
polling_data$state[is.na(polling_data$state)] <- 'National'

# Create a variable for days until election
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    days_until_election = as.numeric(election_date - end_date)
  )

# Save the cleaned data back to CSV
write_csv(polling_data, "data/cleaned_polling_data.csv")
Explanation:

Changed data reading to use your CSV file.
At the end, saved the cleaned data as a new CSV file.

How the Code Works with Your CSV Data
Reading Data: All scripts now read data directly from CSV files using read_csv.
Data Types: When reading dates from CSV, ensure they are correctly parsed. read_csv attempts to parse dates, but you may need to explicitly convert them using as.Date, as shown in the cleaning script.
Factors: Convert categorical variables to factors when preparing data for modeling.
Saving Data: Cleaned data is saved back to CSV files, so you can easily inspect and share them if needed.
Model Storage: Models are saved as RDS files because they are complex R objects. This is standard practice for saving models in R.
Additional Tips
Large Datasets: If your dataset is very large, reading CSV files can be time-consuming. In such cases, consider:

Using data.table: The fread function from the data.table package is faster than read_csv.
r
Copy code
library(data.table)
polling_data <- fread("data/presidential_polls.csv")
Optimizing CSV Reading: Use the col_types parameter in read_csv to specify data types and speed up reading.
r
Copy code
polling_data <- read_csv("data/presidential_polls.csv", col_types = cols(
  start_date = col_date(),
  end_date = col_date(),
  # Specify other columns as needed
))
Data Integrity: Ensure your CSV files are properly formatted and don't have issues like missing headers or inconsistent delimiters.

Data Types: Be mindful of data types when reading from CSV. For example, dates might be read as characters and need conversion.

Working with the Updated Scripts
Set Up Your Project Directory:

Place your presidential_polls.csv file in the data directory.
Run the Scripts in Order:

02-read_data.R: Reads your CSV data into R.
03-clean_data.R: Cleans the data and saves the cleaned version as cleaned_polling_data.csv.
04-test_analysis_data.R: Tests the cleaned data for any issues.
05-exploratory_data_analysis.R: Performs exploratory data analysis on the cleaned data.
06-model_data.R: Builds the predictive model using the cleaned data.
07-replications.R: Uses the model to make predictions and forecasts.
Understand Each Script:

Data Reading and Cleaning: The scripts read data from CSV files, clean it, and prepare it for analysis.
Testing: Ensures data integrity before modeling.
Modeling: Builds a statistical model to predict outcomes.
Prediction: Applies the model to make predictions and generate forecasts.
Benefits of Using CSV Files
Simplicity: CSV files are straightforward and easy to work with.
Portability: CSV files can be opened and edited in many programs, making them easy to share.
Transparency: The data is in a human-readable format.
Conclusion
You can confidently proceed with your analysis using your CSV files. The scripts have been updated to accommodate working directly with CSVs, and I've explained how each script functions so you can make any further adjustments as needed.

Thought for 27 seconds

It looks like you're encountering an error when trying to convert the start_date, end_date, and election_date columns to Date type. The error message:

vbnet
Copy code
Error in `mutate()`:
ℹ In argument: `start_date = as.Date(start_date)`.
Caused by error in `charToDate()`:
! character string is not in a standard unambiguous format
indicates that the date strings in your data are not in a format that as.Date() can parse by default. Let's resolve this step by step.

1. Inspect the Date Format
First, let's check the format of the date strings in your dataset to determine the correct way to parse them.

r
Copy code
# Look at the first few entries of start_date
head(polling_data$start_date)
Possible Output:

csharp
Copy code
[1] "10/18/24" "10/7/24"  "10/17/24" "10/17/24" "9/15/24"  "9/13/24"
This suggests that the dates are in the format "MM/DD/YY".

2. Use lubridate to Parse Dates
Since the dates are in "Month-Day-Year" format with a two-digit year, you can use the mdy() function from the lubridate package, which is designed to handle this format.

Update your code as follows:

r
Copy code
# Convert date columns to Date type using mdy()
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = mdy(end_date),
    election_date = mdy(election_date)
  )
3. Verify the Conversion
After parsing the dates, it's a good idea to check that the conversion worked correctly.

r
Copy code
# Check the structure of the date columns
str(polling_data$start_date)
str(polling_data$end_date)
str(polling_data$election_date)

# View the first few entries
head(polling_data$start_date)
Expected Output for str():

css
Copy code
Date[1:15937], format: "2024-10-18" "2024-10-07" "2024-10-17" ...
4. Handle Any Remaining Issues
If you still encounter errors or warnings, consider the following:

Missing or Invalid Dates:

Check for any missing or invalid date entries that might cause parsing issues.

r
Copy code
# Identify rows with problematic dates
problematic_dates <- polling_data %>%
  filter(is.na(start_date) | is.na(end_date) | is.na(election_date))

# View problematic rows
View(problematic_dates)
Consistent Date Formats:

Ensure that all date entries follow the same format. Mixed date formats can cause parsing errors.

5. Full Updated Code Block
Here is your updated script with the changes:

r
Copy code
#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: Cleans the raw polling data
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Current Date]
# Contact: [Your Email]
# License: [Appropriate License]

#### Workspace setup ####
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(readr)

# Read in the data from CSV
polling_data <- read_csv("data/01-raw_data/president_polls.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Filter for general election polls
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(
    office_type == "U.S. President",
    stage == "general",
    !is.na(candidate_name),
    !is.na(pct)
  )

# Convert date columns to Date type using lubridate
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = mdy(end_date),
    election_date = mdy(election_date)
  )

# Ensure percentages are between 0 and 100
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(pct >= 0 & pct <= 100)

# Fill missing state with 'National'
polling_data$state[is.na(polling_data$state)] <- 'National'

# Create a variable for days until election
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    days_until_election = as.numeric(election_date - end_date)
  )

# Save the cleaned data back to CSV
write_csv(polling_data, "data/cleaned_polling_data.csv")
6. Additional Tips
Check Date Formats in Raw Data:

If mdy() doesn't work for some dates, it's possible that some entries have different formats. You can check for unique date formats:

r
Copy code
unique_dates <- unique(polling_data$start_date)
print(unique_dates)
Parsing Four-Digit Years:

If your dates have four-digit years (e.g., "10/18/2024"), mdy() will handle them correctly.

Parsing Dates with Different Separators:

If some dates use dashes or other separators (e.g., "10-18-24"), mdy() can still parse them. If not, you might need to replace separators:

r
Copy code
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    start_date = mdy(gsub("-", "/", start_date)),
    end_date = mdy(gsub("-", "/", end_date)),
    election_date = mdy(gsub("-", "/", election_date))
  )
Handling Two-Digit vs. Four-Digit Years:

mdy() can handle both two-digit and four-digit years, but it's important to ensure that the century is correctly inferred. For years like "24", mdy() assumes the 21st century (i.e., 2024).

7. Verify the Entire Data Processing Pipeline
After making these changes, rerun your entire data processing script to ensure that everything works smoothly.

Run 03-clean_data.R
Then, proceed to 04-test_analysis_data.R to test the cleaned data
8. Proceed with Your Analysis
Once the date conversion issue is resolved, you can continue with your exploratory data analysis and modeling.

Thought for 9 seconds

Thank you for providing the sample of your data and the details about the error you're encountering. The issue arises because the as.Date() function in R requires the date strings to be in a specific, unambiguous format, or you need to specify the format explicitly if the dates are in a different format.

In your dataset, the date columns like start_date, end_date, and election_date are in the format "MM/DD/YY", such as "10/18/24" for October 18, 2024. The default as.Date() function doesn't know how to interpret this format without additional information.

Solution: Specify the Date Format
You need to specify the date format when using as.Date() so that R can correctly parse the dates.

Here's how you can update your code:

r
Copy code
# Convert date columns to Date type with specified format
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    start_date = as.Date(start_date, format = "%m/%d/%y"),
    end_date = as.Date(end_date, format = "%m/%d/%y"),
    election_date = as.Date(election_date, format = "%m/%d/%y")
  )
Alternatively, you can use the lubridate package, which provides convenient functions for parsing dates.

Using lubridate Package
Since your dates are in "Month-Day-Year" format with two-digit years, you can use the mdy() function from the lubridate package:

r
Copy code
library(lubridate)

# Convert date columns to Date type using mdy()
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = mdy(end_date),
    election_date = mdy(election_date)
  )
Explanation:

mdy() automatically parses dates in "Month-Day-Year" format.
It correctly handles two-digit years and assumes years like "24" are 2024.
Verify the Conversion
After converting the dates, it's good practice to check if the conversion worked:

r
Copy code
# Check the structure of the date columns
str(polling_data$start_date)
head(polling_data$start_date)
You should see that start_date, end_date, and election_date are now of class Date and display the dates correctly.

library(lubridate)
library(readr)

# Read in the data from CSV
polling_data <- read_csv("data/01-raw_data/president_polls.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Filter for general election polls
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(
    office_type == "U.S. President",
    stage == "general",
    !is.na(candidate_name),
    !is.na(pct)
  )

# Convert date columns to Date type using lubridate's mdy()
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = mdy(end_date),
    election_date = mdy(election_date)
  )

# Ensure percentages are between 0 and 100
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(pct >= 0 & pct <= 100)

# Fill missing state with 'National'
polling_data$state[is.na(polling_data$state)] <- 'National'

# Create a variable for days until election
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    days_until_election = as.numeric(election_date - end_date)
  )

# Save the cleaned data back to CSV
write_csv(polling_data, "data/cleaned_polling_data.csv")
Additional Notes
Handling Two-Digit Years:

The mdy() function interprets two-digit years based on the cutoff of 68/69. Years 00-68 are treated as 2000-2068, and years 69-99 are treated as 1969-1999. Since you're working with future dates (e.g., 24 for 2024), mdy() correctly interprets them as 2024.

Verifying Dates:

After conversion, verify that the dates make sense:

r
Copy code
summary(polling_data$start_date)
summary(polling_data$end_date)
summary(polling_data$election_date)
Checking for Parsing Issues:

If some dates are still NA after conversion, there might be inconsistencies in the date formats. You can identify problematic entries:

r
Copy code
polling_data %>%
  filter(is.na(start_date) | is.na(end_date) | is.na(election_date)) %>%
  select(start_date, end_date, election_date) %>%
  distinct()
Then, inspect and correct these entries as needed.

Understanding the Date Formats
Format Specifiers:

%m: Month as a decimal number (01-12)
%d: Day of the month as a decimal number (01-31)
%y: Year without century (00-99)
Example:

For the date string "10/18/24", using format = "%m/%d/%y" tells as.Date() or mdy() to interpret this as:

Month: 10 (October)
Day: 18
Year: 24 (interpreted as 2024)
Summary
Problem: The as.Date() function could not parse dates in "MM/DD/YY" format without specifying the format.
Solution: Use as.Date() with the correct format parameter or use lubridate::mdy().
Implementation: Updated the mutate() function to correctly parse the dates.
Proceeding with Your Analysis

for cleaning remeber Donald trump is Donald Trump Jr.
ChatGPT

Thought for 14 seconds

Understood! To address your note about cleaning the candidate names—specifically that "Donald Trump" is referred to as "Donald Trump Jr." in your data—we need to standardize the candidate names during the cleaning process.

Here's the updated 03-clean_data.R script with the necessary changes:

03-clean_data.R (Updated)
r
Copy code
# 03-clean_data.R

#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: Cleans the raw polling data
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Current Date]
# Contact: [Your Email]
# License: [Appropriate License]

#### Workspace setup ####
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(readr)

# Read in the data from CSV
polling_data <- read_csv("data/01-raw_data/president_polls.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Filter for general election polls
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(
    office_type == "U.S. President",
    stage == "general",
    !is.na(candidate_name),
    !is.na(pct)
  )

#### Candidate Name Cleaning ####

# Standardize candidate names
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    candidate_name = case_when(
      candidate_name == "Donald Trump Jr." ~ "Donald Trump",
      # Add other name corrections if necessary
      TRUE ~ candidate_name
    )
  )

# Optionally, check for other inconsistencies
unique_candidates <- unique(polling_data$candidate_name)
print("Unique candidate names after standardization:")
print(unique_candidates)

#### Date Conversion ####

# Convert date columns to Date type using lubridate's mdy()
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = mdy(end_date),
    election_date = mdy(election_date)
  )

#### Additional Cleaning Steps ####

# Ensure percentages are between 0 and 100
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(pct >= 0 & pct <= 100)

# Fill missing state with 'National'
polling_data$state[is.na(polling_data$state)] <- 'National'

# Create a variable for days until election
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    days_until_election = as.numeric(election_date - end_date)
  )

# Save the cleaned data back to CSV
dir.create("data/02-analysis_data", showWarnings = FALSE)
write_csv(polling_data, "data/02-analysis_data/cleaned_polling_data.csv")
Explanation of Changes
Candidate Name Standardization:

Issue: In your dataset, "Donald Trump" is listed as "Donald Trump Jr.", which can cause inconsistencies in analysis.
Solution: Added a mutate() step using case_when() to replace "Donald Trump Jr." with "Donald Trump".
r
Copy code
candidate_name = case_when(
  candidate_name == "Donald Trump Jr." ~ "Donald Trump",
  TRUE ~ candidate_name
)
Benefit: Ensures that all references to Donald Trump are consistent, improving the accuracy of aggregations and analyses.
Optional Check for Other Inconsistencies:

Printed the unique candidate names after standardization to identify any other inconsistencies.
r
Copy code
unique_candidates <- unique(polling_data$candidate_name)
print("Unique candidate names after standardization:")
print(unique_candidates)
Action: Review the output and, if necessary, add more conditions to case_when() to correct other candidate names.
Data Paths:

Ensured that the cleaned data is saved to your specified directory:
r
Copy code
write_csv(polling_data, "data/02-analysis_data/cleaned_polling_data.csv")
Also added dir.create() to create the directory if it doesn't exist.
Adjustments to Other Scripts
With the candidate names standardized, you can proceed to run the other scripts without additional modifications. The standardization ensures consistency across your analysis.

However, if you have any references to candidate names in the other scripts (e.g., filtering for specific candidates), make sure they use the standardized names.

Running the Updated Script
Update and Save the Script:

Replace the existing 03-clean_data.R script with the updated version above.
Run the Script:

Execute the script in R to clean the data.
The script will read the raw data, perform the cleaning (including the candidate name correction), and save the cleaned data to data/02-analysis_data/cleaned_polling_data.csv.
Verify the Output:

Check the console output for the list of unique candidate names to ensure that the standardization worked correctly.
Open the cleaned CSV file to confirm that "Donald Trump Jr." has been replaced with "Donald Trump".
Proceeding with Your Analysis
Testing:

Run 04-test_analysis_data.R to ensure that the cleaned data passes all tests.
Since we've modified the candidate names, the tests should reflect the standardized names.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Run 05-exploratory_data_analysis.R to perform EDA.
The plots and summaries will now include the standardized candidate names.
Model Building and Predictions:

Run 06-model_data.R to build your model.
Run 07-replications.R to make predictions and forecast the election outcome.
The model will now accurately aggregate data for Donald Trump.
Additional Notes
Other Candidate Names:

If there are other candidates with inconsistent naming (e.g., middle initials, suffixes like "Sr.", "III"), you can add more conditions to the case_when() function.
r
Copy code
candidate_name = case_when(
  candidate_name == "Donald Trump Jr." ~ "Donald Trump",
  candidate_name == "Joe Biden Jr." ~ "Joe Biden",
  # Add other corrections as needed
  TRUE ~ candidate_name
)
This ensures all candidate names are consistent throughout your dataset.
Data Integrity:

Always verify that the changes made during cleaning do not inadvertently alter the data.
Keep backups of your raw data in case you need to revert changes.

Error: Test failed
ChatGPT

Thought for 6 seconds

I see that you're encountering test failures due to missing values in the sample_size and methodology columns when running your 04-test_analysis_data.R script. The error messages indicate that there are missing values in these key columns, which the tests expect to be complete.

Here's what's happening:

Issue: The test is failing because there are missing (NA) values in the sample_size and methodology columns in your cleaned data.
Impact: Missing values in key columns can affect the validity of your analysis and modeling, so it's important to handle them appropriately.
Steps to Resolve the Issue
Identify Missing Values:

Determine how many and which rows have missing values in sample_size and methodology.
Understand whether it's appropriate to remove these rows or impute the missing values.
Update the Cleaning Script (03-clean_data.R):

Modify the script to handle missing values in sample_size and methodology.
Options include removing rows with missing values or imputing them if reasonable.
Re-run the Cleaning Script:

After updating the script, re-run it to generate a new cleaned dataset without missing values in the key columns.
Re-run the Testing Script (04-test_analysis_data.R):

With the updated cleaned data, the tests should pass if all missing values in key columns are addressed.
Detailed Steps and Code Updates
1. Identify Missing Values
Let's first check how many missing values are present in sample_size and methodology.

r
Copy code
# In 03-clean_data.R or in a separate R session

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Read the cleaned data
polling_data <- read_csv("data/02-analysis_data/cleaned_polling_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Check for missing values in 'sample_size' and 'methodology'
missing_sample_size <- polling_data %>% filter(is.na(sample_size))
missing_methodology <- polling_data %>% filter(is.na(methodology))

# Count missing values
cat("Number of missing values in 'sample_size':", nrow(missing_sample_size), "\n")
cat("Number of missing values in 'methodology':", nrow(missing_methodology), "\n")

# Optionally, view the rows with missing values
# View(missing_sample_size)
# View(missing_methodology)
Expected Output:

typescript
Copy code
Number of missing values in 'sample_size': [number]
Number of missing values in 'methodology': [number]
This will tell you how many rows have missing values in these columns.

2. Decide How to Handle Missing Values
Options:

Option A: Remove Rows with Missing Values

If the number of missing values is small and removing those rows won't significantly impact your analysis, you can filter them out.
Option B: Impute Missing Values

If you prefer to keep these rows, you could impute missing values using reasonable assumptions.
Given that sample_size and methodology are important for your analysis, and since the tests require these columns to have no missing values, it's advisable to remove rows with missing values in these columns.

3. Update the Cleaning Script (03-clean_data.R)
Add steps to filter out rows with missing values in sample_size and methodology.

    !is.na(sample_size),
    !is.na(methodology)
  )

#### Additional Cleaning Steps ####

# Ensure percentages are between 0 and 100
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(pct >= 0 & pct <= 100)

# Fill missing state with 'National'
polling_data$state[is.na(polling_data$state)] <- 'National'

# Create a variable for days until election

  mutate(
    days_until_election = as.numeric(election_date - end_date)
  )

# Save the cleaned data back to CSV
dir.create("data/02-analysis_data", showWarnings = FALSE)
write_csv(polling_data, "data/02-analysis_data/cleaned_polling_data.csv")
Explanation:

Added Filtering for Missing Values:

r
Copy code
# Remove rows with missing values in 'sample_size' and 'methodology'
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(sample_size),
    !is.na(methodology)
  )
Rationale:

Since sample_size and methodology are key columns for your analysis and modeling, it's important that they have complete data.
Removing rows with missing values in these columns ensures data integrity.
4. Re-run the Cleaning Script
Run 03-clean_data.R:

This will produce a new cleaned dataset without missing values in sample_size and methodology.
5. Re-run the Testing Script (04-test_analysis_data.R)
With the updated cleaned data, run your testing script again.

Expected Outcome:

The tests should now pass, confirming that there are no missing values in the key columns.
Alternative Approach: Imputing Missing Values
If you prefer to keep the rows with missing values, you could consider imputing them.

Imputing 'sample_size'
Option: Replace missing sample_size with the median or mean sample_size of similar polls.
Example:

r
Copy code
# Impute missing 'sample_size' with median sample size
median_sample_size <- median(polling_data$sample_size, na.rm = TRUE)

polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    sample_size = ifelse(is.na(sample_size), median_sample_size, sample_size)
  )
Imputing 'methodology'
Option: Replace missing methodology with "Unknown" or the most frequent methodology.
Example:

r
Copy code
# Impute missing 'methodology' with 'Unknown'
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    methodology = ifelse(is.na(methodology), "Unknown", methodology)
  )
Note:

Imputing missing values introduces assumptions into your data, which can affect the analysis.
Ensure that any imputation is justifiable and documented.
Updating the Tests if Necessary
If you decide to impute missing values or accept missing values in certain columns, you may need to adjust your tests.

For example, if you allow methodology to be "Unknown", your test should ensure that there are no NA values, but "Unknown" is acceptable.

Proceeding with Analysis
After Handling Missing Values:

Re-run your testing script to ensure all tests pass.
Proceed with the exploratory data analysis, modeling, and prediction scripts.
Documentation:

Document any changes made during the cleaning process, including how missing values were handled.
This is important for transparency and reproducibility.
Summary
Issue: Tests failed due to missing values in sample_size and methodology.
Solution: Updated the cleaning script to remove rows with missing values in these key columns.
Next Steps: Re-run the cleaning and testing scripts, then proceed with the analysis.

ChatGPT

Thought for 13 seconds

Absolutely, I understand that working with a large dataset of 15,938 rows requires careful handling, especially in cleaning and visualization to ensure efficiency and clarity. I'll provide updated scripts with all necessary fixes, taking into account the size of your data, and standardizing graphs and outputs.

Updated 03-clean_data.R
Let's start by fixing all issues in the cleaning script:

library(readr)

# Read in the data from CSV
polling_data <- read_csv("data/01-raw_data/president_polls.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Filter for general election polls
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(
    office_type == "U.S. President",
    stage == "general",
    !is.na(candidate_name),
    !is.na(pct)
  )

#### Candidate Name Cleaning ####

# Standardize candidate names
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    candidate_name = case_when(
      candidate_name == "Donald Trump Jr." ~ "Donald Trump",
      TRUE ~ candidate_name
    )
  )

#### Handle Missing Values in Key Columns ####

# Remove rows with missing values in key columns
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(sample_size),
    !is.na(methodology),
    !is.na(start_date),
    !is.na(end_date),
    !is.na(election_date)
  )

#### Date Conversion ####

# Convert date columns to Date type using lubridate's mdy()
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = mdy(end_date),
    election_date = mdy(election_date)
  )

#### Additional Cleaning Steps ####

# Ensure percentages are between 0 and 100
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(pct >= 0 & pct <= 100)

# Fill missing state with 'National'
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    state = if_else(is.na(state) | state == "", "National", state)
  )

# Create a variable for days until election
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    days_until_election = as.numeric(election_date - end_date)
  )

# Remove rows with negative days until election (if any)
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(days_until_election >= 0)

#### Save Cleaned Data ####

# Ensure the directory exists
dir.create("data/02-analysis_data", showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)

# Save the cleaned data back to CSV
write_csv(polling_data, "data/02-analysis_data/cleaned_polling_data.csv")
Explanation of Fixes and Updates:

Handled Missing Values in Date Columns:

Added filtering to remove rows with missing start_date, end_date, and election_date.
Ensured 'state' Column is Cleaned:

Replaced missing or empty state values with 'National'.
Removed Negative 'days_until_election':

Excluded any polls where days_until_election is negative, as these are likely erroneous.
Recursive Directory Creation:

Used recursive = TRUE in dir.create() to ensure that the directory path is created even if intermediate directories are missing.
Ensured Data Consistency:

The script now comprehensively addresses missing values and standardizes key columns.
Adjustments for Large Dataset in Other Scripts
Given the size of your dataset, it's important to optimize the scripts for performance and visualization clarity.

Visualization Improvements:

Adjusted plot dimensions for clarity.
Removed legend when not necessary to declutter the plot.
General Recommendations for Large Datasets
Use Efficient Data Structures:

Use data.table if performance becomes an issue, as it's optimized for large datasets.
Avoid Unnecessary Computations:

When possible, perform calculations on subsets of data.
Optimize Plots:

Use binning or density plots instead of scatter plots when overplotting occurs.
Limit the number of categories displayed in plots (e.g., top candidates or states).
Consider Sampling:

For exploratory purposes, you can sample a subset of data to visualize trends without overwhelming the plots.
Example of Sampling:

r
Copy code
# Sample 5000 rows for plotting
set.seed(123)
polling_sample <- polling_data %>% sample_n(5000)

# Use polling_sample in your ggplot calls
Next Steps
Re-run the Cleaning Script:

Execute the updated 03-clean_data.R script to generate the cleaned dataset.
Verify the Cleaned Data:

Check the output CSV and confirm that all issues are resolved.
Run the Testing Script:

Execute 04-test_analysis_data.R to ensure the data passes all tests.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis:

Run 05-exploratory_data_analysis.R and review the generated plots and summary statistics.
Build the Model:

Run 06-model_data.R to create the predictive model.
Make Predictions:

Execute 07-replications.R to generate predictions and visualize the results.
Additional Tips
Documentation:

Keep detailed notes of all changes and assumptions made during data cleaning and analysis.
Version Control:

Use Git or another version control system to track changes to your scripts.
Performance Monitoring:

If you notice performance issues, consider profiling your code to identify bottlenecks.
Backup Your Data:

Always keep a copy of the raw data in case you need to revisit your cleaning steps.
Conclusion
By updating the cleaning script and adjusting the analysis scripts to handle the large dataset, you should now have a robust workflow that efficiently processes your data and produces clear, standardized outputs. The adjustments made take into account the size of your data and ensure that your graphs and analyses are both accurate and visually effective.

Percentages per poll do not sum to approximately 100

Error: Test failed
ChatGPT

Thought for 11 seconds

I understand that you're encountering a failure in your testing script 04-test_analysis_data.R, specifically with the test:

r
Copy code
test_that("Percentage sums to approximately 100 per poll", {
  pct_sums <- cleaned_data %>%
    group_by(poll_id) %>%
    summarise(total_pct = sum(pct))
  # Allowing for small rounding errors
  expect_true(all(abs(pct_sums$total_pct - 100) < 1), info = "Percentages per poll do not sum to approximately 100")
})
The error message indicates that for some polls, the percentages of the candidates do not sum to approximately 100%, causing the test to fail.

Understanding the Issue
This test checks that for each poll, the sum of the percentages (pct) across all candidates is within 1% of 100%. If any poll's total percentage deviates by more than 1% from 100%, the test will fail.

Given that your dataset is large (15,938 rows), it's possible that some polls:

Include or Exclude Certain Responses:

Undecided Voters: Polls may include an "Undecided" option that isn't being accounted for.
Third-Party Candidates: Some polls might include or exclude certain third-party or independent candidates.
Other Options: Responses like "Other," "Refused," or "No Answer" might be present.
Data Entry Errors:

There might be errors or inconsistencies in the data that cause the percentages not to sum to 100%.
Rounding Errors:

Small rounding errors in individual percentages can accumulate, leading to a total that slightly deviates from 100%.
Steps to Diagnose and Resolve the Issue
1. Identify Polls with Sum Deviations
Let's find out which polls are failing the test and by how much.

r
Copy code
# Identify polls where the total percentage doesn't sum to approximately 100%
pct_sums <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(poll_id) %>%
  summarise(total_pct = sum(pct)) %>%
  mutate(deviation = abs(total_pct - 100)) %>%
  arrange(desc(deviation))

# View polls with deviations greater than 1%
problem_polls <- pct_sums %>% filter(deviation >= 1)

print(problem_polls)
This will give you a list of polls where the total percentage deviates by more than 1% from 100%.

2. Investigate the Causes
For each of these problem polls, let's check what's causing the deviation.

r
Copy code
# For the first problematic poll
first_problem_poll_id <- problem_polls$poll_id[1]

# Get the data for this poll
poll_data <- cleaned_data %>% filter(poll_id == first_problem_poll_id)

print(poll_data)
Look at the candidate_name and pct values for this poll. Are there any candidates missing? Are there options like "Undecided," "Other," or "No Answer"?

3. Check for Missing Options
It's common for polls to include options beyond the main candidates. If these options are not included in your data, the percentages for the candidates won't sum to 100%.

Possible Missing Options:
Undecided
Other
Refused
Not Sure
None of the Above
These options might have been excluded during data collection or cleaning.

4. Decide How to Handle These Cases
Option A: Include Missing Options

Add Missing Options to Your Data:
If your data source includes these options but they were filtered out, you can include them back in.
Update your filtering criteria in 03-clean_data.R to include these options.
Option B: Adjust the Test Criteria

Relax the Test Threshold:
Increase the allowed deviation from 1% to a higher value, e.g., 5%.
r
Copy code
expect_true(all(abs(pct_sums$total_pct - 100) < 5), info = "Percentages per poll do not sum to approximately 100")
Accept That Some Polls May Not Sum to 100%:
Modify the test to allow for exceptions or to log warnings instead of failing.
Option C: Exclude Incomplete Polls

Filter Out Polls Where Percentages Don't Sum to Approximately 100%:
In your cleaning script, remove these polls from the dataset.
Implementing a Solution
Option A: Include Missing Options
If you suspect that options like "Undecided" or "Other" are missing, you can adjust your cleaning script to include them.

Update 03-clean_data.R:

r
Copy code
# Modify the filter to include entries where candidate_name is NA or matches certain options
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(
    office_type == "U.S. President",
    stage == "general",
    !is.na(pct)
  )
# Note: Removed '!is.na(candidate_name)' to include rows where candidate_name might be NA (e.g., 'Undecided')

# Optionally, fill missing candidate names
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    candidate_name = if_else(is.na(candidate_name), "Undecided", candidate_name)
  )
Note: Be cautious with this approach, as including responses without candidate names may introduce ambiguity. Ensure that any additional options are correctly labeled.

Option B: Adjust the Test Criteria
If it's acceptable for your analysis that some polls don't sum to exactly 100%, you can adjust the test.

Update 04-test_analysis_data.R:

r
Copy code
test_that("Percentage sums to approximately 100 per poll", {
  pct_sums <- cleaned_data %>%
    group_by(poll_id) %>%
    summarise(total_pct = sum(pct))
  # Allowing for larger rounding errors
  expect_true(all(abs(pct_sums$total_pct - 100) < 5), info = "Percentages per poll do not sum to approximately 100")
})
This change increases the allowed deviation to 5%.

Alternatively, you can modify the test to report which polls are failing without causing the entire test suite to fail.

Example:

r
Copy code
test_that("Percentage sums to approximately 100 per poll", {
  pct_sums <- cleaned_data %>%
    group_by(poll_id) %>%
    summarise(total_pct = sum(pct))
  # Find polls where the total percentage deviates significantly
  problem_polls <- pct_sums %>% filter(abs(total_pct - 100) >= 1)
  
  expect_true(nrow(problem_polls) == 0, info = paste("Found", nrow(problem_polls), "polls where percentages do not sum to approximately 100"))
})
This test will fail and report the number of problematic polls.

Option C: Exclude Incomplete Polls
If polls that don't sum to approximately 100% are considered unreliable for your analysis, you can remove them.

Update 03-clean_data.R:

r
Copy code
# Calculate total percentage per poll
pct_sums <- polling_data %>%
  group_by(poll_id) %>%
  summarise(total_pct = sum(pct))

# Identify polls that sum to approximately 100%
valid_polls <- pct_sums %>%
  filter(abs(total_pct - 100) < 1) %>%
  pull(poll_id)

# Filter the data to include only valid polls
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(poll_id %in% valid_polls)
Recommended Approach
Given the importance of data integrity in your analysis, I recommend the following steps:

1. Investigate and Include Missing Options
Include Options Like "Undecided" and "Other":
These options are significant and can affect the interpretation of polling data.
Including them provides a more complete picture.
Update 03-clean_data.R:

Ensure that you do not exclude these options during filtering:

r
Copy code
# Remove the filter that excludes NA candidate names
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  filter(
    office_type == "U.S. President",
    stage == "general",
    !is.na(pct)
  )
Check for Common Labels:
Investigate what labels are used for undecided or other options in your data.
Standardize these labels if necessary.
Standardize Option Names:

r
Copy code
# Standardize candidate names
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    candidate_name = case_when(
      candidate_name == "Donald Trump Jr." ~ "Donald Trump",
      is.na(candidate_name) ~ "Undecided",
      candidate_name %in% c("Other", "No Answer", "Refused") ~ "Other",
      TRUE ~ candidate_name
    )
  )
2. Recalculate Percentages Including All Options
After including these options, re-run your test to see if the percentages now sum to approximately 100%.

3. Adjust the Test Threshold if Necessary
If Small Deviations Persist:
Accept a slightly higher threshold (e.g., 2%) to account for rounding errors.
Revised Cleaning Script Snippet
r
Copy code
# 03-clean_data.R

# ... (previous code)

#### Candidate Name Cleaning ####

# Standardize candidate names, including missing ones
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    candidate_name = case_when(
      candidate_name == "Donald Trump Jr." ~ "Donald Trump",
      is.na(candidate_name) ~ "Undecided",
      candidate_name %in% c("Other", "No Answer", "Refused") ~ "Other",
      TRUE ~ candidate_name
    )
  )

# ... (rest of the code)
Re-run the Tests
After updating the cleaning script:

Run 03-clean_data.R to regenerate the cleaned data.

Run 04-test_analysis_data.R to check if the test passes.

If the test still fails:

Investigate Remaining Issues:

r
Copy code
# Identify polls still not summing to 100%
pct_sums <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(poll_id) %>%
  summarise(total_pct = sum(pct)) %>%
  filter(abs(total_pct - 100) >= 1)

print(pct_sums)
Examine Individual Polls:

r
Copy code
# For each problematic poll
for (poll_id in pct_sums$poll_id) {
  poll_data <- cleaned_data %>% filter(poll_id == poll_id)
  print(poll_data)
}
Determine if Further Action is Needed:

You might need to accept a slightly larger threshold or handle specific cases individually.
Adjusting the Test in 04-test_analysis_data.R
If, after including all options, there are still a few polls that don't sum to approximately 100%, you can adjust the test threshold slightly:

r
Copy code
test_that("Percentage sums to approximately 100 per poll", {
  pct_sums <- cleaned_data %>%
    group_by(poll_id) %>%
    summarise(total_pct = sum(pct))
  # Allowing for small rounding errors
  expect_true(all(abs(pct_sums$total_pct - 100) < 2), info = "Percentages per poll do not sum to approximately 100")
})
Conclusion
Key Points:

Poll percentages may not sum to 100% due to missing options like "Undecided" or "Other."
Including these options provides a more accurate and complete dataset.
Adjusting the test threshold slightly can account for minor deviations due to rounding errors.
Next Steps:

Update your cleaning script to include all relevant options.
Re-run the cleaning script to generate the updated dataset.
Run the testing script to verify that the data now passes the tests.
Proceed with your analysis scripts.

Warning messages:
1: Computation failed in stat_smooth()
Caused by error in simpleLoess():
! span is too small 
2: Computation failed in stat_smooth()
Caused by error in simpleLoess():
! span is too small 
ChatGPT

Thought for 57 seconds

I see that you're encountering warnings related to stat_smooth() when running your exploratory data analysis script. Specifically, the warnings are:

go
Copy code
Warning messages:
1: Computation failed in `stat_smooth()`
Caused by error in `simpleLoess()`:
! span is too small 
2: Computation failed in `stat_smooth()`
Caused by error in `simpleLoess()`:
! span is too small 
These warnings occur when generating the plots, particularly with geom_smooth() using the LOESS method. The issue is that for some candidates, there isn't enough data to fit a LOESS smoother with the specified span, causing the function to fail.

Understanding the Issue
LOESS Smoothing: LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) requires sufficient data points to perform the smoothing. When the span parameter is too small relative to the number of data points, the smoothing algorithm can't compute the result.
Large Number of Candidates: Your dataset includes 59 candidates, many of whom have very few data points. This can cause the LOESS smoother to fail for those candidates.
Solution
To resolve this issue, we'll:

Filter Out Candidates with Insufficient Data:
Exclude candidates with too few data points (e.g., fewer than 100 polls) to ensure the smoother has enough data.
Adjust the span Parameter or Use a Different Smoothing Method:
Increase the span parameter or use a more robust method like Generalized Additive Models (GAM).
Updated Code
1. Filter Candidates with Enough Data
First, we'll filter the dataset to include only candidates with at least 100 polls.

r
Copy code
# Filter candidates with at least 100 polls
candidate_counts <- polling_data %>%
  count(candidate_name) %>%
  filter(n >= 100)

polling_data_filtered <- polling_data %>%
  filter(candidate_name %in% candidate_counts$candidate_name)
2. Update Visualizations
Use the filtered dataset polling_data_filtered for your plots.

r
Copy code
# Plot candidate percentages over time
ggplot(polling_data_filtered, aes(x = end_date, y = pct, color = candidate_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess', se = FALSE) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  labs(title = "Candidate Poll Percentages Over Time",
       x = "End Date of Poll",
       y = "Percentage",
       color = "Candidate") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Save plot
ggsave("plots/candidate_percentages_over_time.png", width = 10, height = 6)
Note: If the error persists, we can adjust the geom_smooth() function.

3. Adjust the Smoothing Method
If filtering doesn't fully resolve the issue, switch to the GAM smoothing method, which is more robust for datasets with varying data densities.

r
Copy code
# Plot candidate percentages over time with GAM smoothing
ggplot(polling_data_filtered, aes(x = end_date, y = pct, color = candidate_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'gam', formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs"), se = FALSE) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  labs(title = "Candidate Poll Percentages Over Time",
       x = "End Date of Poll",
       y = "Percentage",
       color = "Candidate") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Save plot

# Save plot
ggsave("plots/percentage_distribution_per_candidate.png", width = 10, height = 6)
Explanation:

Filtering Data:
Only includes candidates with at least 100 polls to ensure sufficient data for smoothing.
Using GAM Smoothing:
Switched to Generalized Additive Models (method = 'gam') with a cubic spline basis (bs = "cs").
Converted the x variable to numeric within the formula: y ~ s(as.numeric(x), bs = "cs").
This helps avoid issues with date variables in smoothing functions.
Note: Ensure that the mgcv package is installed, as it's required for GAM smoothing.

r
Copy code
install.packages("mgcv")
Alternative Solution: Adjust the span Parameter
If you prefer to stick with LOESS smoothing, you can increase the span parameter to include more data points in the local regression.

r
Copy code
# Using LOESS with increased span
ggplot(polling_data_filtered, aes(x = end_date, y = pct, color = candidate_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess', se = FALSE, span = 0.5) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  labs(title = "Candidate Poll Percentages Over Time",
       x = "End Date of Poll",
       y = "Percentage",
       color = "Candidate") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
Addressing the Histogram Warning
You mentioned that the warning occurs when saving the histogram of percentages per candidate. Since we've filtered the data to include only candidates with sufficient data, this issue should also be resolved.

Summary
Issue: The LOESS smoother in geom_smooth() failed due to too few data points for some candidates, especially with a small span.
Solution: Filter out candidates with insufficient data and adjust the smoothing method or parameters.
Updated Script: Modified 05-exploratory_data_analysis.R to include these changes.
Next Steps
Run the Updated Script:
Execute the modified 05-exploratory_data_analysis.R script.
Verify the Outputs:
Check the generated plots in the plots directory.
Ensure that the warnings have been resolved.
Proceed with Analysis:

You said:
why you only got 2 cancidates now in exploratory analysis?? get more
ChatGPT

Thought for 11 seconds

You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion. The reason only two candidates are appearing in the exploratory analysis is because the filtering threshold was set too high in the script—specifically, we were including only candidates with at least 100 polls. This threshold inadvertently excluded other candidates you wish to analyze.

Understanding the Issue
High Threshold: The threshold of 100 polls is too restrictive given your data, resulting in only the top two candidates (likely Donald Trump and Joe Biden) being included.
Previous Smoothing Errors: Earlier, we set a high threshold to prevent errors with geom_smooth() when plotting candidates with very few data points.
Your Requirement: You want to include more candidates in the exploratory analysis, even if they have fewer polls.
Solution
To include more candidates in the exploratory analysis, we'll adjust the threshold to include candidates with fewer polls. Additionally, we'll modify the smoothing method to handle candidates with less data.

Here's how we'll proceed:

Lower the Threshold:
Reduce the minimum number of polls required to include a candidate (e.g., from 100 to 30).
Adjust the Smoothing Method:
Use a more robust smoothing method that can handle fewer data points.
For candidates with very few data points, we might omit the smoother or adjust the span parameter.

Explanation of Changes:
Lowered Threshold to 30 Polls:

This allows more candidates to be included in the analysis.
The number 30 is a common threshold in statistics to balance data sufficiency and inclusivity.
Adjusted Smoothing Method:

Used method = 'loess' with span = 0.5 to make the smoother more flexible.
Set na.rm = TRUE to handle any potential NA values.
LOESS can be more appropriate for smaller datasets when adjusted properly.
Increased alpha in geom_point():

Slightly increased the point transparency to alpha = 0.4 for better visibility.
Optional: Including All Candidates
If you wish to include all candidates regardless of the number of polls, you can remove the filtering step altogether:

r
Copy code
# Comment out or remove the filtering step
# polling_data_filtered <- polling_data %>%
#   filter(candidate_name %in% candidate_counts$candidate_name)

# Use the full dataset
polling_data_filtered <- polling_data
Note: When including candidates with very few data points, you may still encounter smoothing errors for those candidates. To address this, you can:

Handle Smoothing Errors:
Use tryCatch() to bypass errors for problematic candidates.
Or, exclude geom_smooth() for candidates with fewer than a certain number of polls.
Example:

r
Copy code
# Identify candidates with few polls
few_polls_candidates <- summary_stats %>%
  filter(n_polls < 10) %>%
  pull(candidate_name)

# Plot without smoothing for candidates with few polls
ggplot(polling_data, aes(x = end_date, y = pct, color = candidate_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = polling_data %>% filter(!candidate_name %in% few_polls_candidates),
    method = 'loess',
    se = FALSE,
    span = 0.5
  ) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  labs(title = "Candidate Poll Percentages Over Time",
       x = "End Date of Poll",
       y = "Percentage",
       color = "Candidate") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

Re-Running the Scripts
Update Thresholds:

Modify the threshold in all scripts where candidates are filtered based on the number of polls.
Adjust the threshold to a value that balances inclusivity and data reliability.
Test the Changes:

Run 05-exploratory_data_analysis.R and ensure that more candidates are included in the plots.
Check that the smoothing functions work without errors.
Review Outputs:

Examine the plots to confirm that they include more candidates.
Verify that the model includes additional candidates in the modeling and prediction steps.
Important Considerations
Data Sufficiency:

Be cautious when including candidates with very few polls, as the statistical reliability of analyses may decrease.
Document the number of polls for each candidate to provide context in your analysis.
Visualization Clarity:

With more candidates, plots can become cluttered.
Consider using facets or interactive plots to improve readability.
Example: Using Facets

r
Copy code
# Facet the plot by candidate
ggplot(polling_data_filtered, aes(x = end_date, y = pct)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1, color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess', se = FALSE, span = 0.5) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  labs(title = "Candidate Poll Percentages Over Time",
       x = "End Date of Poll",
       y = "Percentage") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~ candidate_name, scales = "free_y")
Note: Using facet_wrap() will create separate panels for each candidate, making it easier to visualize trends without overplotting.
Conclusion
By lowering the threshold and adjusting the smoothing methods, you can include more candidates in your exploratory analysis. This approach allows you to analyze and visualize data for a broader range of candidates, meeting your project's requirements.

You said:
I am only seeing 2 candiates in plot in exploratory analysis
ChatGPT

Thought for 5 seconds

I understand that you're still only seeing two candidates in your exploratory analysis plots, even after we've adjusted the threshold and made changes to include more candidates. Let's work together to diagnose and resolve this issue so that all desired candidates are included in your analysis.

Possible Reasons for Only Two Candidates Appearing
Data Filtering Still Too Restrictive:

The filtering condition in the script might still be excluding other candidates.
Data Issues:

There may be missing or inconsistent data for other candidates.
Candidate names might not be standardized correctly.
Plotting Code Limiting Candidates:

The plotting code might be unintentionally limiting the number of candidates displayed.
Data Contains Only Two Candidates with Sufficient Data:

It's possible that only two candidates have enough data points based on the current filtering criteria.
Steps to Diagnose and Fix the Issue
Let's go through step by step to identify where the problem lies.

1. Check the Number of Candidates in the Cleaned Data
First, let's see how many unique candidates are present in your cleaned data.

r
Copy code
# Read the cleaned data
polling_data <- read_csv("data/02-analysis_data/cleaned_polling_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Get the number of unique candidates
unique_candidates <- polling_data %>%
  distinct(candidate_name) %>%
  arrange(candidate_name)

print("List of unique candidates in the cleaned data:")
print(unique_candidates)
Action:

Run this code to see how many candidates are present after cleaning.
Verify that all expected candidates are listed.
2. Check the Number of Polls per Candidate
Let's see how many polls each candidate has in the cleaned data.

r
Copy code
# Count the number of polls per candidate
candidate_counts <- polling_data %>%
  count(candidate_name) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

print("Number of polls per candidate:")
print(candidate_counts)
Action:

Run this code to see the number of polls for each candidate.
Identify if there are candidates with zero or very few polls.
3. Remove Filtering Based on Poll Counts
To ensure that all candidates are included, let's remove any filtering based on the number of polls.

Updated 05-exploratory_data_analysis.R:

r
Copy code
# 05-exploratory_data_analysis.R

# ... (previous code)

#### EDA ####

# ... (summary statistics code)

# Remove filtering based on the number of polls
polling_data_filtered <- polling_data

#### Visualizations ####

# ... (visualization code)
Explanation:

By setting polling_data_filtered <- polling_data, we include all candidates regardless of the number of polls.
4. Adjust the Plotting Code
With all candidates included, we might need to adjust the plotting code to handle candidates with few data points.

Update the Plotting Code:

r
Copy code
# Plot candidate percentages over time
ggplot(polling_data_filtered, aes(x = end_date, y = pct, color = candidate_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 1) +
  # Use tryCatch to handle errors in geom_smooth for candidates with few data points
  stat_smooth(
    method = 'loess',
    se = FALSE,
    span = 0.5,
    na.rm = TRUE,
    fullrange = TRUE
  ) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  labs(title = "Candidate Poll Percentages Over Time",
       x = "End Date of Poll",
       y = "Percentage",
       color = "Candidate") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
Explanation:

Using stat_smooth() instead of geom_smooth() can sometimes handle data with fewer points more gracefully.
Setting fullrange = TRUE ensures the smoother spans the entire range of the data.
5. Check for Data Issues with Candidate Names
There might be inconsistencies in candidate names that are causing them to be grouped incorrectly.

Check Unique Candidate Names:

r
Copy code
unique_candidates <- polling_data %>%
  distinct(candidate_name) %>%
  arrange(candidate_name)

print("Unique candidate names:")
print(unique_candidates)
Action:

Look for variations or misspellings in candidate names.
Standardize candidate names if necessary.
Update 03-clean_data.R to Standardize Names:

r
Copy code
# Standardize candidate names
polling_data <- polling_data %>%
  mutate(
    candidate_name = case_when(
      candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump Jr.", "Donald J. Trump") ~ "Donald Trump",
      candidate_name %in% c("Joseph R. Biden", "Joe Biden Jr.") ~ "Joe Biden",
      candidate_name %in% c("Kamala D. Harris") ~ "Kamala Harris",
      is.na(candidate_name) ~ "Undecided",
      candidate_name %in% c("Other", "No Answer", "Refused") ~ "Other",
      TRUE ~ candidate_name
    )
  )
Explanation:

Added more variations of candidate names to be standardized.
This ensures that all data for a candidate is aggregated correctly.
6. Re-Run the Cleaning Script
After updating the cleaning script to standardize candidate names more thoroughly, re-run 03-clean_data.R to regenerate the cleaned data.

7. Verify the Number of Candidates Again
Repeat step 1 to check the unique candidates and ensure that all expected candidates are present.

8. Re-Run the Exploratory Analysis Script
After re-running the cleaning script, run 05-exploratory_data_analysis.R again and see if more candidates appear in your plots.

9. Use Facets to Improve Visualization
When plotting many candidates, the plot can become cluttered. Using facets can help.

Updated Plot with Facets:

r
Copy code
# Plot candidate percentages over time using facets
ggplot(polling_data_filtered, aes(x = end_date, y = pct)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 1, color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(
    method = 'loess',
    se = FALSE,
    span = 0.5,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  labs(title = "Candidate Poll Percentages Over Time",
       x = "End Date of Poll",
       y = "Percentage") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~ candidate_name, scales = "free_y")
Explanation:

Faceting creates a separate plot for each candidate, making it easier to visualize trends.
scales = "free_y" allows each plot to have its own y-axis scale.
10. Handle Candidates with Very Few Data Points
For candidates with very few data points, consider excluding them from the smoothing or noting that trends may not be reliable.

Identify Candidates with Few Polls:

r
Copy code
# Candidates with fewer than 5 polls
few_polls_candidates <- candidate_counts %>%
  filter(n < 5) %>%
  pull(candidate_name)

print("Candidates with fewer than 5 polls:")
print(few_polls_candidates)
Exclude These Candidates from Smoothing:

r
Copy code
# Plot with smoothing only for candidates with enough data
ggplot(polling_data_filtered, aes(x = end_date, y = pct, color = candidate_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = polling_data_filtered %>% filter(!candidate_name %in% few_polls_candidates),
    method = 'loess',
    se = FALSE,
    span = 0.5,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  labs(title = "Candidate Poll Percentages Over Time",
       x = "End Date of Poll",
       y = "Percentage",
       color = "Candidate") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
11. Check for Data Filtering Elsewhere in the Script
Ensure there are no other filtering steps that might be excluding candidates.

Look for any filter() or subset() functions that might be limiting the data unintentionally.
Summary of Steps
Update 03-clean_data.R to ensure all candidate names are standardized correctly.
Re-run the cleaning script to generate updated cleaned data.
Verify the unique candidates in the cleaned data.
Adjust the exploratory analysis script to include all candidates without filtering based on the number of polls.
Modify the plotting code to handle candidates with few data points and avoid errors.
Use facets to improve visualization when dealing with many candidates.
Exclude smoothing for candidates with very few polls to prevent errors.
Next Steps
Implement the Updates:

10 Ron DeSantis   
Now, let's update the scripts after the exploratory analysis—specifically 06-model_data.R and 07-replications.R—to include all these candidates in your modeling and prediction steps.

Updated 06-model_data.R Script
We'll adjust the modeling script to include all the candidates you've listed. Here are the steps we'll follow:

Ensure All Candidates Are Included:
Remove or adjust any filtering based on the number of polls per candidate.
Check for Sufficient Data:
While including all candidates, we'll be cautious about candidates with very few polls, as this can affect model reliability.
Adjust the Model If Necessary:
Modify the model to handle potential issues arising from candidates with less data.
Here's the updated 06-model_data.R script:

Explanation:
Included All Candidates:
Used candidates_to_include to specify the candidates you want in the model.
No Filtering Based on Poll Counts:
All listed candidates are included, regardless of the number of polls.
Checked Number of Polls Per Candidate:
Printed out the counts to understand the data distribution.
Adjusted Model Considerations:
Acknowledged that candidates with very few polls may affect model stability.
Decided to proceed with the model while being aware of potential limitations.
Random Effects:
Included random intercepts for candidate_factor, pollster_factor, and state_factor.
Did not include random slopes due to potential instability with candidates having few data points.
Updated 07-replications.R Script
Now, let's update the prediction script to match the modeling script.

#### Data Preparation ####

# Prepare data for prediction

                           "Jill Stein", "Cornel West", "Chase Oliver", "Ron DeSantis",
                           "Nikki Haley", "Gavin Newsom")

cat("Predicted winner:", winner, "\n")

#### Visualization ####

# Create plots directory if it doesn't exist

       fill = "Candidate") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# Save plot
ggsave("plots/predicted_percentages_by_candidate.png", width = 8, height = 6)
Explanation:
Consistent Candidate Inclusion:
Used the same candidates_to_include as in the modeling script.
Predictions:
Made predictions for all included candidates.
Aggregated Predictions:
Calculated the mean predicted percentage for each candidate.
Included n_polls to show the number of polls contributing to each candidate's prediction.
Visualization:
Created a bar plot of the predicted percentages for all candidates.
Adjusted the plot to accommodate more candidates by using coord_flip().
Important Considerations
Candidates with Few Polls:
Be cautious interpreting results for candidates with very few polls (e.g., less than 10).
The model's predictions for these candidates may be less reliable.
Model Stability:
Including candidates with minimal data can affect model convergence and stability.
Monitor model diagnostics and warnings.
Additional Updates
Print Model Diagnostics:

In 06-model_data.R, after summary(model), you can add:

r
Copy code
# Check for model convergence issues
if (!is.null(model@optinfo$conv$lme4$messages)) {
  warning("Model convergence warnings:")
  print(model@optinfo$conv$lme4$messages)
}
Adjust Random Effects Structure:

If the model fails to converge or produces warnings, you might need to simplify the random effects structure:

r
Copy code
# Simplify the model if necessary
model <- lmer(
  pct ~ days_until_election + sample_size + methodology_factor + population_factor +
    (1 | candidate_factor) + (1 | pollster_factor),
  data = polling_data_filtered,
  REML = FALSE,
  control = lmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa")
)
Removed (1 | state_factor) to simplify the model.
This might help with convergence when including many candidates with varying data sizes.
Re-Running the Scripts
Update and Save the Scripts:

Replace the existing 06-model_data.R and 07-replications.R scripts with the updated versions above.
Run the Modeling Script:

Execute 06-model_data.R.
Monitor the console for any warnings or errors.
Ensure the model summary makes sense and includes all the candidates.
Run the Prediction Script:

Execute 07-replications.R.
Check the printed predictions and ensure all candidates are included.
Verify that the plot is generated and saved correctly.
Review the Outputs:

Open predicted_percentages_by_candidate.png in the plots directory.
Confirm that the plot displays all candidates as expected.

Predicted winner: Kamala Harris
Notes:

Predicted Winner: Based on the mean predicted percentages, Kamala Harris has the highest value.
Interpretation: The predictions are averages across the polling data and the model's adjustments.
Caution: For candidates with fewer polls (e.g., Gavin Newsom), predictions may be less reliable.
Conclusion
By updating the scripts to include all the candidates you're interested in, you can now proceed with your analysis and predictions accordingly. Remember to interpret the results with consideration of the data limitations for candidates with fewer polls.

Additional Recommendations
Data Visualization:
For the predicted_percentages_by_candidate.png plot, consider adjusting the y-axis limits or using percentage labels for clarity.
Model Diagnostics:
Review the model diagnostics to ensure it's appropriate for your data.
Sensitivity Analysis:
Consider running the model with and without candidates with very few polls to assess the impact on the results.

Thought for 34 seconds

Certainly! I'll provide updated scripts that do not use the lme4 package and include the exploratory analysis again. We'll replace the mixed-effects modeling with an alternative method that doesn't rely on lme4. For the modeling step, we'll use standard linear regression (lm) for each candidate individually.

Explanation:

Predictions: For each candidate model, we predict the polling percentages on their respective data.
Aggregation: The predicted percentages are averaged per candidate.
Visualization: A bar plot displays the predicted average percentages for each candidate.
Notes and Recommendations
Data Sufficiency: Be cautious when interpreting results for candidates with fewer than 30 polls, as their models may not be reliable.
Model Assumptions: Standard linear regression assumes linear relationships, homoscedasticity, and normally distributed residuals. Check these assumptions using diagnostic plots.
Percentage Data: Since percentages are bounded between 0 and 100, consider transforming the data or using models suitable for bounded outcomes (e.g., beta regression) for more accurate results.
Alternative Modeling Approaches: If appropriate, consider multinomial logistic regression or other models that can handle multiple categories and bounded data.

Warning messages:
1: In predict.lm(model, newdata = candidate_data) :
  prediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading
2: In predict.lm(model, newdata = candidate_data) :
  prediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading
ChatGPT

Thought for 24 seconds

I understand that you're encountering warnings when running your prediction script, specifically:

yaml
Copy code
Warning messages:
1: In predict.lm(model, newdata = candidate_data) :
  prediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading
2: In predict.lm(model, newdata = candidate_data) :
  prediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading
Additionally, you're noticing that only two candidates—Kamala Harris and Donald Trump—are appearing in your predictions and plots.

Let's address these issues step by step.

Understanding the Issues
1. Rank-Deficient Fit Warning
Cause: A rank-deficient fit in linear regression occurs when there is perfect multicollinearity among predictor variables, or when one or more predictors are constants (have zero variance). This leads to a singular matrix in the regression calculation, making it impossible to uniquely estimate the coefficients.

Impact: The warning indicates that the model may not be reliable, and predictions based on it could be misleading.

2. Only Two Candidates in Predictions
Cause: The modeling script is likely building models only for candidates with sufficient data (e.g., at least 30 polls). If only Kamala Harris and Donald Trump meet this criterion, only their models are built and used for predictions.
Solutions
1. Addressing the Rank-Deficient Fit Warning
To resolve the rank-deficiency issue in your models:

Investigate the Predictor Variables: Check if any of the predictor variables (methodology, population, state) have only one level (i.e., all values are the same) for a candidate's data.

Possible Causes:

Constant Predictors: If, for a specific candidate, all polls were conducted using the same methodology, population type, or in the same state, these variables become constants and offer no predictive power.
Sparse Data: Limited variation in the data can lead to singularities in the regression matrix.
Solution: Modify the model to exclude constant or problematic predictors for each candidate.

2. Including More Candidates in Predictions
To include more candidates:

Lower the Data Threshold: Reduce the minimum number of polls required to build a model for a candidate.

Adjust the Modeling Approach: Use a combined model that includes data from all candidates, allowing for better estimation even for those with fewer data points.

Implementing the Solutions
Step 1: Modify the Modeling Script
Updated 06-model_data.R:

r
Copy code
# 06-model_data.R

#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: Builds predictive models for each candidate using linear regression
# Author: [Your Name]

#### Workspace setup ####
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Read the cleaned data from CSV
polling_data <- read_csv("data/02-analysis_data/cleaned_polling_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

#### Data Preparation ####

# Include all candidates listed
candidates_to_include <- c("Donald Trump", "Joe Biden", "Kamala Harris", "Robert F. Kennedy",
                           "Jill Stein", "Cornel West", "Chase Oliver", "Ron DeSantis",
                           "Nikki Haley", "Gavin Newsom")

polling_data_filtered <- polling_data %>%
  filter(candidate_name %in% candidates_to_include)

# Create a dataset for modeling
model_data <- polling_data_filtered %>%
  select(pct, candidate_name, days_until_election, sample_size, methodology, population, state)

# Convert categorical variables to factors
model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    methodology = factor(methodology),
    population = factor(population),
    state = factor(state)
  )

#### Modeling ####

# Build a combined linear regression model for all candidates
model <- lm(pct ~ candidate_name + days_until_election + sample_size + methodology + population + state, data = model_data)

# Check for rank deficiency
if (any(is.na(coef(model)))) {
  warning("Model coefficients contain NA values due to rank deficiency.")
}

# Save the model
dir.create("models", showWarnings = FALSE)
saveRDS(model, "models/combined_candidate_model.rds")
Explanation:

Combined Model: Instead of building separate models for each candidate, we build a single combined model that includes candidate_name as a predictor.
Benefits:
Allows sharing of information across candidates.
Reduces issues with insufficient data for individual candidates.
Addressing Rank Deficiency:
By including all data, we increase variability in predictors.
Potential issues with rank deficiency are minimized.
Step 2: Update the Prediction Script
Updated 07-replications.R:

r

#### Data Preparation ####

# Include all candidates listed
candidates_to_include <- c("Donald Trump", "Joe Biden", "Kamala Harris", "Robert F. Kennedy",
                           "Jill Stein", "Cornel West", "Chase Oliver", "Ron DeSantis",
                           "Nikki Haley", "Gavin Newsom")

polling_data_filtered <- polling_data %>%
  filter(candidate_name %in% candidates_to_include)

# Prepare data for prediction
model_data <- polling_data_filtered %>%
  select(pct, candidate_name, days_until_election, sample_size, methodology, population, state)

# Convert categorical variables to factors
model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    candidate_name = factor(candidate_name),
    methodology = factor(methodology),
    population = factor(population),
    state = factor(state)
  )

#### Predictions ####

# Make predictions using the combined model
model_data$predicted_pct <- predict(model, newdata = model_data)

# Aggregate predictions by candidate
candidate_predictions <- model_data %>%
  group_by(candidate_name) %>%
  summarise(
    predicted_pct = mean(predicted_pct, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_polls = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(predicted_pct))

print("Predicted percentages by candidate:")
print(candidate_predictions)

# Forecast the winner
winner <- candidate_predictions$candidate_name[1]
cat("Predicted winner:", winner, "\n")

#### Visualization ####

# Create plots directory if it doesn't exist
dir.create("plots", showWarnings = FALSE)

# Plot predicted percentages
ggplot(candidate_predictions, aes(x = reorder(candidate_name, predicted_pct), y = predicted_pct, fill = candidate_name)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Predicted Average Poll Percentages by Candidate",
       x = "Candidate",
       y = "Predicted Percentage",
       fill = "Candidate") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# Save plot
ggsave("plots/predicted_percentages_by_candidate.png", width = 8, height = 6)
Explanation:

Combined Predictions: We use the combined model to predict percentages for all candidates in the data.
Data Preparation: Ensure that candidate_name is converted to a factor in model_data for prediction.
No Rank Deficiency Warnings: The combined model should mitigate rank deficiency issues.
Step 3: Check Model Diagnostics
Check for Warnings: If you still receive rank deficiency warnings, examine the model summary using summary(model) to identify any coefficients that are NA or variables that are causing issues.

Simplify the Model:

Reduce the Number of Predictors: If certain variables are causing problems due to low variability or high multicollinearity, consider removing them from the model.
Example:
r
Copy code
model <- lm(pct ~ candidate_name + days_until_election + sample_size, data = model_data)
Rationale: Using fewer predictors can improve model stability, especially when data is limited.
Additional Recommendations
1. Examine Predictor Variables
Check for Low Variability:
Use table() or summary() to check the distribution of categorical variables like methodology, population, and state.
If a variable has little to no variation, it might not be informative and could be excluded.
2. Consider Variable Selection Techniques
Stepwise Regression:

Use techniques like stepwise regression (step()) to select the most significant predictors.
Regularization Methods:

Consider using regularization methods like Ridge or Lasso regression, which can handle multicollinearity and perform variable selection.
Note: These methods are available in packages like glmnet.
3. Transform the Response Variable
Percentage Data Considerations:
Since pct represents percentages (bounded between 0 and 100), you might consider transforming it or using a model suitable for proportion data.
Option: Use a beta regression model (available in the betareg package) for variables that take values in (0, 1).
4. Check Model Assumptions
Diagnostic Plots:
Use plot(model) to check residuals, normality, and homoscedasticity.
Address Violations:
If assumptions are violated, consider transforming variables or using robust regression methods.
Next Steps
Implement the Updated Scripts:

Replace your existing 06-model_data.R and 07-replications.R scripts with the updated versions above.
Run the Modeling Script:

Execute 06-model_data.R.
Review the model summary and check for any warnings or errors.
Run the Prediction Script:

Execute 07-replications.R.
Confirm that predictions are made for all candidates and that no rank deficiency warnings appear.
Review the Outputs:

Check the printed predictions to ensure all candidates are included.
Examine the generated plot to verify it displays all candidates appropriately.
Adjust if Necessary:

If warnings persist or the model performance is unsatisfactory, consider simplifying the model or exploring alternative modeling approaches as mentioned above.
Conclusion
By building a combined linear regression model that includes all candidates, we can:

Resolve Rank Deficiency: Increase variability in predictors and avoid singularities in the regression matrix.

Include All Candidates: Ensure that predictions are made for all candidates, even those with limited data.

Simplify Modeling Process: Reduce complexity by managing a single model instead of multiple individual models.

ChatGPT

Thought for 10 seconds

I see that you're encountering a warning message indicating that your model coefficients contain NA values due to rank deficiency:

perl
Copy code
Warning message:
In eval(ei, envir) :
  Model coefficients contain NA values due to rank deficiency.
This warning means that some of the predictors in your linear regression model are linearly dependent or perfectly correlated, causing the model to be unable to uniquely estimate all coefficients. Let's work through this issue step by step to identify the cause and find a solution.

Understanding Rank Deficiency
Rank Deficiency: Occurs when one or more predictors in your model are exact linear combinations of other predictors. This leads to a singular matrix in the regression calculations, and as a result, the model cannot uniquely estimate all coefficients.
Impact on Model: Coefficients associated with the problematic predictors will be NA, and the model's interpretations and predictions may be unreliable.
Diagnosing the Issue
1. Examine the Model Summary
First, let's look at the summary of your model to identify which coefficients are NA:

r
Copy code
summary(model)
Action:

Run the above code to see the detailed summary of your model.
Look for coefficients that have NA values or are not estimated.
2. Identify Problematic Predictors
The summary output will help you identify which predictors are causing the rank deficiency.

Common Causes:
Dummy Variable Trap: When including categorical variables with multiple levels, you need to be careful to avoid perfect multicollinearity.
Redundant Variables: Predictors that are linear combinations of other predictors.
Sparse Data: Some levels of categorical variables may not have enough observations, leading to singularities.
Resolving the Issue
1. Addressing Categorical Variables
When including categorical variables (factors) in regression models, R uses dummy coding (also known as one-hot encoding) to create binary variables for each level of the factor, excluding one reference level. If not handled properly, this can lead to rank deficiency.

Possible Solutions:

Reduce Levels of Factors:

Combine Rare Levels: For factors like state, methodology, and population, consider combining levels with few observations into an "Other" category.
Exclude Predictors with Too Many Levels: Variables like state may have too many levels (e.g., 50 states plus "National") and could cause issues.
Remove Redundant Predictors:

Correlation Analysis: Check for high correlations between predictors.
Domain Knowledge: Use your understanding of the data to decide which predictors are essential.
2. Simplify the Model
Start by simplifying your model to include only the most important predictors.

Example:

r
Copy code
# Simplified model without 'state'
model <- lm(pct ~ candidate_name + days_until_election + sample_size + methodology + population, data = model_data)
Check for Rank Deficiency Again:

r
Copy code
if (any(is.na(coef(model)))) {
  warning("Model coefficients contain NA values due to rank deficiency.")
} else {
  cat("Model coefficients are estimated without rank deficiency.\n")
}
3. Examine the Predictors Individually
Check Levels of Each Factor:

r
Copy code
# Number of levels in each factor
cat("Number of levels in candidate_name:", nlevels(model_data$candidate_name), "\n")
cat("Number of levels in methodology:", nlevels(model_data$methodology), "\n")
cat("Number of levels in population:", nlevels(model_data$population), "\n")
cat("Number of levels in state:", nlevels(model_data$state), "\n")
Identify Levels with Few Observations:

r
Copy code
# Check counts of each level
table(model_data$methodology)
table(model_data$population)
table(model_data$state)
Action:

Identify any levels with very few observations.
Consider combining or removing these levels.
4. Recode Factors with Many Levels
Combine Rare Levels:

r
Copy code
# For 'state', combine states with few observations
state_counts <- table(model_data$state)
rare_states <- names(state_counts[state_counts < 30])  # Threshold can be adjusted

model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    state = if_else(state %in% rare_states, "Other", as.character(state)),
    state = factor(state)
  )
Reduce Levels of 'methodology' and 'population' if Necessary:

If these variables have levels with few observations, consider combining them similarly.
5. Rebuild the Model
After recoding, rebuild your model:

r
Copy code
# Rebuild the model with simplified factors
model <- lm(pct ~ candidate_name + days_until_election + sample_size + methodology + population + state, data = model_data)

# Check for rank deficiency
if (any(is.na(coef(model)))) {
  warning("Model coefficients contain NA values due to rank deficiency.")
} else {
  cat("Model coefficients are estimated without rank deficiency after recoding.\n")
}
Alternative Approach: Exclude High Cardinality Predictors
If rank deficiency persists, consider excluding predictors with high cardinality or low variability.

Example:

r
Copy code
# Exclude 'state' and 'methodology' if necessary
model <- lm(pct ~ candidate_name + days_until_election + sample_size, data = model_data)

# Check the model
summary(model)
Implementing the Solution
1. Update 06-model_data.R
Here's the updated script with the modifications:

                           "Nikki Haley", "Gavin Newsom")

polling_data_filtered <- polling_data %>%

    state = if_else(state %in% rare_states, "Other", as.character(state)),
    state = factor(state)
  )

# Similarly, recode 'methodology' if necessary

rare_methods <- names(methodology_counts[methodology_counts < 30])

model_data <- model_data %>%

} else {
  cat("Model coefficients are estimated without rank deficiency.\n")
}

# Save the model
dir.create("models", showWarnings = FALSE)
saveRDS(model, "models/combined_candidate_model.rds")
2. Update 07-replications.R
No significant changes are needed in the prediction script unless you change the model structure.

Verify the Solution
Run the Updated 06-model_data.R Script:

Check the console output to see if the warning about rank deficiency persists.
If the warning is gone, proceed to the next step.
If the warning remains, consider further simplifying the model.
Examine the Model Summary:

r
Copy code
summary(model)
Look for any coefficients that are NA.
Ensure that the model makes sense and the predictors are significant.
Run 07-replications.R:

Generate the predictions and verify that all candidates are included.
Check for any warnings during prediction.
Additional Considerations
Check for Multicollinearity
Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):

r
Copy code
library(car)
vif_values <- vif(model)
print(vif_values)
VIF values greater than 5 or 10 indicate potential multicollinearity issues.
Remove or combine predictors with high VIF values.
Model Diagnostics
Residual Plots:

r
Copy code
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model)
Check for patterns in residuals, non-constant variance, and influential points.
Alternative Modeling Techniques
Regularized Regression:

Use glmnet for Lasso or Ridge regression, which can handle multicollinearity and perform variable selection.
Random Forest or Gradient Boosting:

Use tree-based models that are less sensitive to multicollinearity and can capture nonlinear relationships.
Conclusion
By recoding factors to reduce the number of levels and combining rare categories, you can address the rank deficiency in your model. Simplifying the model by excluding less informative predictors can also help.

ChatGPT

Thought for 30 seconds

I see that you're encountering the following error when trying to make predictions using your combined linear model:

vbnet
Copy code
Error in model.frame.default(Terms, newdata, na.action = na.action, xlev = object$xlevels) : 
  factor methodology has new levels IVR, Live Phone, Online Panel/Text-to-Web, Probability Panel, Text
This error occurs because the newdata you're using for prediction contains levels of the factor methodology that were not present in the data used to fit the model. Specifically, the levels IVR, Live Phone, Online Panel/Text-to-Web, Probability Panel, and Text are new levels that the model hasn't seen before.

Understanding the Issue
In R, when you fit a linear model with factor variables, the model stores the levels of those factors as they appear in the training data. When you use predict() with new data, R expects the factor levels in newdata to match exactly those in the original data used to fit the model. If the new data contains levels not seen during training, R cannot make predictions for those levels because the model doesn't have coefficients associated with them.

Solution
To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the factor levels in your newdata match those in the training data used to fit the model. Here's how you can do this:

Ensure Consistent Factor Levels: When converting your variables to factors in model_data, set the levels to match those in the model.

Recode New Levels to "Other" or an Existing Level: If your new data contains levels not present in the training data, you can recode them to an "Other" category or to an existing level.

Update Your Scripts to Reflect These Changes: Modify both your modeling script (06-model_data.R) and your prediction script (07-replications.R) to ensure consistent handling of factor levels.

Implementation Steps
Step 1: Update the Modeling Script (06-model_data.R)
a. Recode Factors During Model Building

When you build your model, ensure that you account for potential new levels by including an "Other" category.

r
Copy code
# 06-model_data.R

# ... [Previous code]

#### Recode Factors ####

# Recode 'methodology' to combine rare levels into 'Other'
methodology_counts <- table(model_data$methodology)
frequent_methodologies <- names(methodology_counts[methodology_counts >= 30])  # Adjust threshold as needed

model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    methodology = if_else(methodology %in% frequent_methodologies, methodology, "Other"),
    methodology = factor(methodology)
  )

# Ensure 'Other' is included in levels
model_data$methodology <- factor(model_data$methodology, levels = c(frequent_methodologies, "Other"))

# ... [Rest of the code]
b. Build the Model

r
Copy code
# Build the combined linear regression model
model <- lm(pct ~ candidate_name + days_until_election + sample_size + methodology + population + state, data = model_data)

# Check for rank deficiency
if (any(is.na(coef(model)))) {
  warning("Model coefficients contain NA values due to rank deficiency.")
} else {
  cat("Model coefficients are estimated without rank deficiency.\n")
}

# Save the model
dir.create("models", showWarnings = FALSE)
saveRDS(model, "models/combined_candidate_model.rds")
Step 2: Update the Prediction Script (07-replications.R)
a. Match Factor Levels in Prediction Data

When preparing your model_data for prediction, set the levels of the factors to match those in the model.

r
Copy code
# 07-replications.R

# ... [Previous code]

#### Data Preparation ####

# Convert categorical variables to factors with levels matching the model
model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    candidate_name = factor(candidate_name, levels = levels(model$model$candidate_name)),
    methodology = factor(methodology, levels = levels(model$model$methodology)),
    population = factor(population, levels = levels(model$model$population)),
    state = factor(state, levels = levels(model$model$state))
  )

# Recode new levels in 'methodology' to 'Other'
model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    methodology = if_else(is.na(methodology), "Other", methodology),
    methodology = factor(methodology, levels = levels(model$model$methodology))
  )

# ... [Rest of the code]
Explanation:

Set Factor Levels: Ensure that the levels of each factor in model_data match those used in the model.
Recode New Levels: Any levels in methodology not present in the model are recoded to "Other".
b. Make Predictions

r
Copy code
# Make predictions using the combined model
model_data$predicted_pct <- predict(model, newdata = model_data)
Detailed Explanation
Why Does This Work?

By setting the levels of your factor variables in model_data to match those in the model, you're ensuring that R knows how to handle each level during prediction.
Recoding new levels to "Other" ensures that your model can make predictions for observations that didn't have those specific levels during training.
Important Notes:

Consistency: Any transformation or recoding applied during model training must be applied identically to the prediction data.
Handling NA Levels: If, after setting the factor levels, some entries become NA because their levels were not present in the model, recode them to "Other" or an appropriate existing level.
Alternative Approaches
1. Exclude Variables with New Levels
If recoding isn't suitable, you might consider excluding the variable causing issues. For example, if methodology isn't a critical predictor, you could build a model without it.

r
Copy code
# Build the model without 'methodology'
model <- lm(pct ~ candidate_name + days_until_election + sample_size + population + state, data = model_data)
2. Use Models That Handle New Factor Levels
Certain modeling techniques can handle new levels in factor variables:

Random Effects Models: Mixed models can sometimes accommodate new levels in random effects.
Tree-Based Models: Decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting methods can handle categorical variables without needing dummy variables and can manage unseen categories.
Verification
After making the changes:

Re-run the Modeling Script (06-model_data.R):

Ensure that the model is built successfully without warnings.
Re-run the Prediction Script (07-replications.R):

Confirm that the predictions are made without errors.
Check that the predicted_pct values are reasonable.
Review the Outputs:

Examine the candidate_predictions to ensure all candidates are included.
Verify that the visualization is generated correctly.

 9 Nikki Haley               38.6     150
10 Gavin Newsom              42.0      65

Predicted winner: Kamala Harris
Conclusion
By ensuring that the factor levels in your prediction data match those in your model and by recoding any new levels appropriately, you can resolve the error and successfully make predictions.

Additional Tips
Consistent Data Processing: Always apply the same data processing steps to both your training and prediction datasets.
Check for Missing Values: Ensure that there are no unexpected NA values in your predictors after recoding.
Document Your Steps: Keep detailed notes on how factors are recoded and levels are handled for future reference.

Explanation:

Data Preparation:
Included all specified candidates.
Selected relevant variables for prediction.
Converted categorical variables to factors with levels matching those in the model.
Recode Factors:
Recode any new levels in state, methodology, and population to "Other" to match the model.
Ensure that the factors have the same levels as in the model to avoid prediction errors.
Predictions:
Used predict() with the adjusted model_data.
Aggregated predictions by candidate.
Printed the predicted percentages and identified the predicted winner.
Visualization:
Created and saved a bar plot of predicted percentages by candidate.
Important Notes
Handling Factor Levels:
The key to avoiding errors during prediction is ensuring that the levels of factor variables in the new data (model_data) match those in the model. This includes handling any new levels by recoding them to "Other" or an existing level.
Avoiding Rank Deficiency:
By recoding rare levels and ensuring sufficient observations for each level, we mitigate the risk of rank deficiency in the model.
Consistency in Data Processing:
Any transformations or recoding applied during model training must be applied identically to the prediction data.
Running the Scripts
Data Cleaning:
Ensure that 03-clean_data.R has been run to generate cleaned_polling_data.csv.
Model Building:
Run 06-model_data.R to build the combined linear regression model.
Check the console output for any warnings.
Review the model summary if necessary using summary(model).
Predictions and Forecasting:
Run 07-replications.R to make predictions and generate the visualization.
Verify that predictions include all candidates.
Ensure that the plot is saved correctly in the plots directory.
Verification:
Open predicted_percentages_by_candidate.png to view the plot.
Confirm that the predicted percentages make sense.
Additional Recommendations
Model Diagnostics:
Use diagnostic plots to check for assumptions of linear regression (e.g., linearity, homoscedasticity, normality of residuals).
r
Copy code
# In 06-model_data.R, after building the model
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model)
Interpretation:
Be cautious when interpreting results for candidates with fewer polls, as predictions may be less reliable.
Documentation:
Document any decisions made during data preparation and modeling, such as thresholds used for recoding.
